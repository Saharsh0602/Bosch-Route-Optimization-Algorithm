# CVRP

This repository contains a python solution to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem.
The CVRP is a hard combinatorial optimisation problem that has had many methods
applied to it. This implementation uses a simple and an advanced genetic algorithm,
mainly distinguished by their population selection and crossover method.

To run, type
```bash
python cvrp_runner.py
```
